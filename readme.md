## üìô Features Breaf

### 1. User Database:
- A json file is considered as the users database, which can be found at `data/users.json`
- Database structure:
```
{
    "name": "Test User",
    "sms": "+911234567890",
    "email": "testuser@gmail.com",
    "subscriptions": [
      {
        "topic": "weather",
        "method": "sms"
      }
    ]
  }
```
    
### 2. Routinely check and send notifications:

- To demonstrate this feature, a weather notification service is available, which periodically checks for notifications and sends it to all the subscribed users.
- To start the weather notifier, set `RUN_WEATHER_NOTIFIER=true` on `.env`
- It uses cron job to trigger periodically.
- Trigger frequency can be modified on the `index.ts` file at `line number 8` by passing cron expressions on to the fuunction `weatherSchedule`.
- Here are some useful cron expressions that can be used:
  - `*/30 * * * * *` : trigger every 30 second
  - `*/1 * * * *` : trigger every minute
  - `*/5 * * * *` : trigger every 5 minute
    
### 3. Flexible to accommodate new mediums:

- SMS and Email service is implemented on the current version of the application. SMS service uses Twilio and Email service uses MailJet.
- Services are dynamically managed by the `NotifierManager` which keeps track of all the registered notification mediums.
- Becuase of it's plugin like strucuture, any new notification mediums can be added very easily with few lines of code.

### 4. Send notification using a selected medium:

- Notification sending process is managed by a Queue Manager (Bull). It helps in keeping track of all the scheduled notifications and bulk sending process.

### 5. Retry send a notification if failed due to some code exception:

- Bull is setup to return each notification 3 times in case of failure. In case all 3 tries are failed, it rejects the notification.

### 6. Easy to test:

- Each part of the application is defined in a seperate module. The entire Notification Service has two main modules.
  - Notifier
  - Scheduler
- More details about the working process of the modules can be found on the **Workflow Diagram** added at the top of the page.
